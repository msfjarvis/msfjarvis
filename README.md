Hey there! I'm Harsh, a 23 year old Android and Kotlin developer with a strong focus on tooling and developer productivity.

I am a prolific contributor to open-source software, and all of my personal projects are built in the open. Here are some mildly interesting ones!

- [Android Password Store](https://github.com/Android-Password-Store/Android-Password-Store): Password manager for Android based on the [pass](https://passwordstore.org/) standard, that uses GPG for encryption.
- [Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters): Read-only Android client for [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- [healthchecks-rs](https://github.com/msfjarvis/healthchecks-rs): Collection of Rust libraries and CLIs for interacting with [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)
- [linkleaner](https://github.com/msfjarvis/linkleaner): Telegram bot written in Rust that replaces links in chats to enhance their link previews.

I blog infrequently at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev/) about anything that tickles my fancy, which happens to be [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) at the moment.

I no longer have an active Twitter, and can be found on the [AndroidDev Mastodon](https://androiddev.social/) server at [@msfjarvis](https://androiddev.social/@msfjarvis).
