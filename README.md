Hey there! I'm Harsh, a 23 year old Android developer.

I am a prolific contributor to open-source software, and all of my personal projects are built in the open. I'm the lead maintainer of [Android Password Store](https://msfjarvis.dev/aps), which has been a pet project of mine for nearly 3 years now. I am also a co-maintainer of [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com)'s Android [client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android). I blog infrequently at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev), about topics like Rust, Kotlin, and Android (not in that order :P).

You can often find me prattling about all sorts of things over on [Mastodon](https://androiddev.social/@msfjarvis).
