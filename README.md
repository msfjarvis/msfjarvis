Hey there! I'm Harsh, a 21 year old Android developer. I work at [Navana Tech](https://navanatech.in), helping to make banking accessible to lower literacy people in India. It's exciting stuff!


I am also a prolific open-source enthusiast, and nearly all of my personal projects are built in the open. I'm the lead maintainer of a little app called [Android Password Store](https://msfjarvis.dev/aps), and also co-maintain the [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) [Android client](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-android). I blog infrequently at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev), about topics like Rust, Kotlin, Android and a smidge of web-related things.
