Hey there! I'm Harsh, a 21 year old Android developer. I work at [Navana Tech](https://navanatech.in), helping to make banking accessible to lower literacy people in India. It's exciting stuff!

I am also a prolific open-source enthusiast, and all of my personal projects are built in the open. I'm also the lead maintainer of [Android Password Store](https://msfjarvis.dev/aps), which has been a pet project of mine for nearly 3 years now. I blog infrequently at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev), about topics like Rust, Kotlin, Android and a tiny smidge of web-related things.

You can often find me prattling about all sorts of things over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSF_Jarvis).
