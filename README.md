Hey there! I'm Harsh, a 22 year old Android developer. I am a Product Engineer at [Obvious](https://obvious.in).

I am also a prolific open-source enthusiast, and all of my personal projects are built in the open. I'm the lead maintainer of [Android Password Store](https://msfjarvis.dev/aps), which has been a pet project of mine for nearly 3 years now. I also am a maintainer of [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com)'s Android [client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android). I blog infrequently at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev), about topics like Rust, Kotlin, and Android (not in that order :P).

You can often find me prattling about all sorts of things over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSF_Jarvis).
